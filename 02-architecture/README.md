## Architecture Overview

### System Layers
1. **Presentation Layer**: Next.js/React frontend, AI chat interface
2. **AI Layer**: AI Gateway, RAG Engine, Context Manager
3. **Application Layer**: Core business services, API Gateway
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Event bus, caching, search, file storage
5. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vector database

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent, scalable services
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Kafka-based async messaging
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Business domain separation
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Organization-based data isolation
- **AI-First Design**: Integrated AI capabilities throughout

### Technology Decisions
- **Python/Django**: Core business logic and rapid development
- **Go**: High-performance background processing
- **Next.js/React**: Modern, responsive frontend
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming and service decoupling
- **Redis**: Caching and real-time features
- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search capabilities
