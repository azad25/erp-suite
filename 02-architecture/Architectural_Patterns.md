🏗️ Core Architectural Patterns
1. Microservices Architecture
Pattern: Distributed system with independently deployable services
Implementation: Separate services for Auth, CRM, HR, Accounting, Inventory, Projects, Analytics
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - This is the gold standard for enterprise applications (used by Netflix, Amazon, Google)
2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
From design.md: "The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design principles with clear separation between core business domains"

Pattern: Business domains as bounded contexts
Implementation: Each ERP module (CRM, HR, Accounting) is a separate domain
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Essential for complex business applications
3. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
From requirements.md: "Apache Kafka as an event bus for async decoupling"

Pattern: Services communicate via events rather than direct calls
Implementation: Kafka for domain events (LeadCreated, InvoicePaid, etc.)
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Critical for scalable, resilient systems
4. Three-Tier Architecture
From design.md: "The system follows a three-tier architecture with AI services integrated as a cross-cutting layer"

Presentation Layer: Next.js/React Frontend
Application Layer: Django/FastAPI + Go microservices
Data Layer: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vector DB
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Classic enterprise pattern
🎯 Advanced Design Patterns
5. API Gateway Pattern
From design.md: "Gateway[API Gateway]" in the architecture diagram

Purpose: Single entry point for all client requests
Benefits: Authentication, rate limiting, request routing
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Essential for microservices (AWS API Gateway, Kong)
6. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Implied from the AI action execution framework in design.md:

class AIActionHandler:
    def execute_action(self, action: AIAction, context: UserContext) -> ActionResult
    def validate_action(self, action: AIAction, context: UserContext) -> ValidationResult
Pattern: Separate read and write operations
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Common in complex business systems
7. Multi-Tenant Architecture
From requirements.md: "Multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control (RBAC)"

Pattern: Single application instance serves multiple tenants
Implementation: organization_id scoping in all data operations
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Standard for SaaS applications (Salesforce, Slack)
8. Circuit Breaker Pattern
From design.md:

class AICircuitBreaker:
    def call_ai_service(self, service_call: Callable) -> Any:
        if self.state == CircuitState.OPEN:
            # Handle failures gracefully
Purpose: Prevent cascading failures
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Netflix Hystrix pattern, essential for resilience
🤖 AI-Specific Patterns
9. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pattern
From design.md: "RAG-enabled chatbot and contextual AI assistance"

Pattern: Combine retrieval with generation for better AI responses
Implementation: Vector database + LLM integration
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Cutting-edge AI pattern (OpenAI, Anthropic)
10. AI Gateway Pattern
From design.md: "AI Gateway Service - Central orchestrator for all AI interactions"

Pattern: Centralized AI request handling and routing
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Emerging standard for AI-enabled applications
🔒 Security & Compliance Patterns
11. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
From requirements.md: "RBAC so that admins, staff, vendors, etc. have appropriate permissions"

Pattern: Permission-based access control
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Security standard across all enterprise systems
12. Audit Trail Pattern
From design.md: Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

Pattern: Track all user actions and system events
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Required for enterprise compliance (SOX, GDPR)
📊 Data Management Patterns
13. Polyglot Persistence
From design.md:

PostgreSQL: Relational data
MongoDB: Logs and analytics
Vector DB: AI embeddings
Redis: Caching and sessions
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Use right database for right purpose
14. Event Sourcing (Partial)
From tasks.md: Event-driven communication via Kafka

Pattern: Store events rather than current state
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Used by major financial and e-commerce systems
🚀 Modern Development Patterns
15. Container-First Architecture
From design.md: Docker containerization for all services

Pattern: Containerized deployment
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Industry standard (Docker, Kubernetes)
16. GitOps/DevOps Patterns
From multi-repo-microservices-plan.md: Separate repositories per service

Pattern: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Modern development standard
17. Observability Pattern
From design.md: Prometheus + Grafana monitoring

Pattern: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing
Industry Standard: ✅ Yes - Essential for production systems
