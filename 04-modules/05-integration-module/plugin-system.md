# Plugin System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive plugin system that allows AI services, Google integrations, and custom extensions to be seamlessly integrated into the ERP system with proper isolation and security.

## Plugin Architecture

### 1. Core Plugin Framework

The plugin system is built around a modular architecture that provides secure isolation, dependency management, and lifecycle control.

```python
# Core plugin interface
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum

class PluginType(Enum):
    AI_PROVIDER = "ai_provider"
    INTEGRATION = "integration"
    BUSINESS_LOGIC = "business_logic"
    UI_EXTENSION = "ui_extension"
    WORKFLOW = "workflow"
    NOTIFICATION = "notification"

@dataclass
class PluginMetadata:
    name: str
    version: str
    description: str
    author: str
    plugin_type: PluginType
    dependencies: List[str]
    permissions: List[str]
    config_schema: Dict[str, Any]
    api_version: str = "1.0"

class PluginInterface(ABC):
    """Base interface for all plugins"""
    
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def metadata(self) -> PluginMetadata:
        """Return plugin metadata"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any], context: 'PluginContext') -> bool:
        """Initialize the plugin with configuration"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def activate(self) -> bool:
        """Activate the plugin"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def deactivate(self) -> bool:
        """Deactivate the plugin"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return plugin health status"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def cleanup(self) -> bool:
        """Clean up plugin resources"""
        pass
```

This plugin system provides a secure, extensible framework for integrating third-party services and custom functionality into the ERP system while maintaining proper isolation and security controls.
