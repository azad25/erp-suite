# Development Planning and Project Management

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the Intelligent ERP Suite as a **subscription-based SaaS platform**. The plan focuses on building a solid SaaS foundation with subscription management, then developing core ERP modules, and finally integrating AI capabilities. The approach includes development phases, task breakdown, GitHub repository management, and deployment strategies.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **SaaS-First Approach**: Build subscription-based SaaS platform from the ground up
2. **Dev-First Experience**: `make up` Dockerized environment, seeded data, local LLM-ready from day one
3. **Modular Microservices**: 14-repository architecture with independent deployment capability
4. **Rapid Development**: Django apps within services, RBAC decorators, React HOCs for fast iteration
5. **Subscription-Driven**: All features controlled by subscription plans and usage limits
6. **Pluggable AI**: RAG/LLM optional, works without AI, plugs in via API with auth-context awareness
7. **RBAC Everywhere**: Every endpoint, page, and action is role-aware and secured
8. **API-First Design**: Design APIs before building UI components with auto-generated docs
9. **Separation of Concerns**: Auth, AI, Business Logic, Frontend, Queue, Monitoring in separate modules

## Phase 1: SaaS Foundation (Months 1-3)

### Dev-First Bootstrap Strategy

Before diving into the monthly breakdown, here's our **dev-first approach** that runs parallel to all development:

#### 🚀 One-Command Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the main orchestrator
git clone https://github.com/intelligent-erp-suite/erp-infrastructure
cd erp-infrastructure

# Start everything with one command
make up

# What this does:
# 1. Clones all 14 repositories
# 2. Starts all services with Docker Compose
# 3. Seeds databases with realistic test data
# 4. Sets up local LLM (Ollama) for AI development
# 5. Configures hot-reloading for all services
# 6. Opens development dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

#### 🏗️ Service Development Pattern
Each service follows this **rapid development structure**:
```
erp-[service]-service/
├── apps/                    # Django apps for business domains
│   ├── core/               # Shared models, utils
│   ├── [domain]/           # Business domain (hr, crm, etc.)
│   └── api/                # API layer with DRF
├── shared/                 # Service-specific shared code
├── tests/                  # Comprehensive test suite
├── docker/                 # Dev and prod Docker configs
├── scripts/                # Dev utilities and seeders
└── Makefile               # Service-specific commands
```

#### 🔒 RBAC Pattern Implementation
```python
# Shared RBAC decorators from erp-shared-libs
from erp_shared.auth import require_permission, require_role
from erp_shared.rbac import RBACViewSet

class EmployeeViewSet(RBACViewSet):
    """Employee management with automatic RBAC"""
    
    @require_permission('hrm.employee.read')
    def list(self, request):
        # Automatic tenant filtering and permission checking
        return super().list(request)
    
    @require_role('hr_manager')
    def create(self, request):
        # Role-based creation with audit logging
        return super().create(request)
```

#### 🎨 Frontend RBAC Pattern
```typescript
// React HOCs for UI-level RBAC
import { withPermission, withRole } from '@erp-shared/react-rbac';

const EmployeeList = withPermission('hrm.employee.read')(
  () => <div>Employee List</div>
);

const CreateEmployee = withRole('hr_manager')(
  () => <div>Create Employee Form</div>
);
```

#### Multi-Service Deployment Environments

**Development Environment**:
- **Purpose**: Individual service development and testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic on feature branch push per service
- **Database**: Service-specific development databases
- **Monitoring**: Service-level logging and metrics
- **Dependencies**: Mock external services

**Staging Environment**:
- **Purpose**: Cross-service integration testing
- **Deployment**: Automatic on develop branch merge
- **Database**: Production-like data (anonymized) per service
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring stack with service mesh
- **Dependencies**: All services deployed together

**Production Environment**:
- **Purpose**: Live SaaS platform for customers
- **Deployment**: Coordinated release with manual approval
- **Database**: Production databases with automated backups
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and tracing
- **Dependencies**: Full service mesh with load balancing

#### Multi-Service Deployment Pipeline

```yaml
# Individual Service Pipeline
Service Code Push → Service CI Tests → Build Service Image → Deploy Service to Dev
     ↓
Service Integration Tests → Security Scan → Deploy Service to Staging
     ↓
Cross-Service Integration Tests → Performance Tests → Service Ready for Production

# Coordinated Release Pipeline  
All Services Ready → Release Coordination → Staged Production Deployment
     ↓
Health Checks → Service Mesh Validation → Full Production Release
     ↓
Monitoring → Performance Validation → Rollback Individual Services if Issues
```

#### Release Coordination
```yaml
# Release Configuration Example
release:
  version: "1.0.0"
  services:
    - erp-auth-service: "1.0.0"
    - erp-subscription-service: "1.0.0" 
    - erp-crm-service: "1.0.0"
    - erp-hrm-service: "1.0.0"
  deployment_order:
    1. erp-auth-service
    2. erp-subscription-service
    3. [erp-crm-service, erp-hrm-service]
    4. erp-frontend

### SaaS Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Key Metrics to Track
- **Application Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates per service
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network per service
- **SaaS Business Metrics**: 
  - Subscription metrics (MRR, churn, conversion rates)
  - Usage tracking (API calls, storage, users per tenant)
  - Feature adoption rates per subscription plan
  - Customer satisfaction and support tickets
- **Multi-Tenant Metrics**: Tenant isolation, resource usage per tenant
- **Security**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity, vulnerabilities per tenant

#### SaaS Maintenance Schedule
- **Daily**: 
  - Automated backups for all service databases
  - Subscription billing processing
  - Usage tracking and limit enforcement
  - Health checks for all services
- **Weekly**: 
  - Security updates across all services
  - Performance reviews and capacity planning
  - Subscription analytics and reporting
  - Customer usage analysis
- **Monthly**: 
  - Full system backup and disaster recovery testing
  - Subscription plan optimization
  - Customer churn analysis
  - Financial reconciliation
- **Quarterly**: 
  - Security audits across all services
  - Performance optimization and architecture review
  - Subscription pricing analysis
  - Customer feedback analysis and product roadmap updates

This comprehensive development plan provides a structured approach to building the Intelligent ERP Suite as a **subscription-based SaaS platform**. The plan focuses on establishing a solid SaaS foundation with subscription management and billing, then developing core ERP modules with feature gating, and finally integrating AI capabilities. The multi-repository approach enables independent service development while maintaining system coherence through shared libraries, coordinated releases, and comprehensive monitoring.
