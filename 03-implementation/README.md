# Implementation Documentation

This folder contains practical implementation guides, development setup instructions, and concrete implementation tasks for the Intelligent ERP Suite.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **[dev-first-setup.md](./dev-first-setup.md)** - Get the entire system running locally with one command
2. **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Detailed implementation tasks with requirements traceability
3. **[docker-compose-dev.md](./docker-compose-dev.md)** - Local development environment configuration

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Files

### Core Implementation
- **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Primary implementation plan with 16 phases and specific tasks
- **[dev-first-setup.md](./dev-first-setup.md)** - One-command development environment setup
- **[docker-compose-dev.md](./docker-compose-dev.md)** - Docker Compose configuration for local development

### Development Patterns
- **[rbac-patterns.md](./rbac-patterns.md)** - Role-based access control implementation patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows the architecture defined in `02-architecture/` with:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services with clear boundaries
- **Docker-First Development**: Containerized development environment
- **Kubernetes-Native Deployment**: Production-ready container orchestration
- **AI-Enhanced Features**: RAG-enabled chatbot and intelligent automation
- **SaaS-Ready**: Multi-tenant with subscription management

## ðŸ“Š Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Use `dev-first-setup.md` to get started quickly
2. **Tasks**: Follow `tasks.md` for structured implementation
3. **Deploy**: Use Kubernetes and Helm configurations for deployment
4. **Monitor**: Implement observability from day one

For architectural decisions and system design, see the `02-architecture/` folder.
