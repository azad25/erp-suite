# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent ERP Suite is an all-in-one, open-source Enterprise Resource Planning platform that integrates core business modules (Accounting, CRM, HR, Inventory/Orders, Project Management, and Analytics) with embedded AI capabilities. The system features a multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control (RBAC) and includes an intelligent chatbot that can interact with users based on their authorization levels, perform data queries, generate reports, and execute actions across the application. The platform supports both local LLM models (like Llama) and external API-based models, with Google services integration for Gmail and Drive functionality.
