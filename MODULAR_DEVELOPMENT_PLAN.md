# Intelligent ERP Suite - Multi-Repository Development Plan

## 🎯 Development Strategy: Service-by-Service with Dev-First Approach

We're building a **14-repository microservices architecture** with a dev-first approach that allows rapid development and independent deployment. Each service is developed as a standalone application with shared RBAC patterns and subscription integration. This approach offers several advantages:

### ✅ Benefits of Multi-Repository Development
- **🚀 Dev-First Experience**: `make up` starts all services with hot reloading and seeded data
- **🔄 Independent Development**: Each service has its own repository and deployment pipeline
- **💰 Reduced Risk**: Smaller, manageable development cycles with shared patterns
- **👥 Team Specialization**: Teams can focus on specific services with shared RBAC utilities
- **📈 Scalable Growth**: Add services based on business priorities with subscription gating
- **🧪 Easier Testing**: Isolated testing per service with shared testing utilities
- **🔒 Consistent RBAC**: Shared authentication, authorization, and tenant isolation patterns
