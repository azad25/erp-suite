## Navigation Guide

### For Project Managers
1. Start with `00-project-overview/README.md` for project introduction
2. Review `01-requirements/requirements.md` for business requirements
3. Check `03-implementation/development-planning.md` for timeline and resources
4. Monitor progress using `03-implementation/tasks.md`

### For Architects
1. Review `02-architecture/design.md` for system design
2. Study `02-architecture/Architectural_Patterns.md` for design patterns
3. Examine `02-architecture/service-breakdown.md` for microservices architecture
4. Check `05-deployment/multi-repo-microservices-plan.md` for deployment strategy

### For Developers
1. Understand requirements from `01-requirements/requirements.md`
2. Study module specifications in `04-modules/core-modules.md`
3. Follow implementation tasks in `03-implementation/tasks.md`
4. Reference API designs in `02-architecture/api-endpoints.md`

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Review `02-architecture/tech-stack.md` for technology requirements
2. Study `05-deployment/multi-repo-microservices-plan.md` for deployment architecture
3. Check `02-architecture/folder-structure.md` for project organization
4. Follow infrastructure setup in `03-implementation/tasks.md` (Tasks 1, 16)

### For Business Stakeholders
1. Read `00-project-overview/README.md` for project overview
2. Review `01-requirements/requirements.md` for business value
3. Check `04-modules/README.md` for feature capabilities
4. Monitor progress via `03-implementation/development-planning.md`

## Document Relationships

### Requirements → Architecture
- Business requirements drive architectural decisions
- Each requirement is traceable to design components
- Non-functional requirements influence technology choices

### Architecture → Implementation
- Design decisions guide implementation tasks
- Service breakdown defines development team structure
- Technology stack determines development approach

### Implementation → Modules
- Implementation tasks build specific module features
- Module specifications guide detailed development
- Testing strategies ensure module quality

### Modules → Deployment
- Module architecture influences deployment strategy
- Service dependencies determine deployment order
- Scaling requirements drive infrastructure decisions

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Document Updates
- Update requirements when business needs change
- Revise architecture when technical decisions evolve
- Modify implementation plans based on progress and learnings
- Enhance module specifications as features develop
- Adjust deployment strategies based on operational experience

### Version Control
- Each document should be version controlled
- Major changes should be reviewed by relevant stakeholders
- Cross-references between documents should be maintained
- Change history should be documented for traceability

### Review Process
- Requirements: Business stakeholders and product managers
- Architecture: Technical architects and senior developers
- Implementation: Development team leads and project managers
- Modules: Feature owners and UX designers
- Deployment: DevOps engineers and infrastructure teams
